//------- ENTIRE FUNCTIONALITY OF CALCULATOR FINISHED -------//

//    --- all that is left, is user experience shit, and small finicky actions ---    //

//------- LIST OF (8 or more) THINGS TO FIX:
//... #1 ... If the user has cleared the entry, and clicks clear again, just show the 0, not the 0 and "CLEARED"
//      because they're not clearing anything, it's already been cleared.

//... #2 ... Fix floating decimal point stuff, so maybe just round the showcased value on top to the fourth decimal place,

//... #3 ... Fix funky spacing issue with equation being too long

//... #4 ... Fix funky spacing issue with value(number) being too long

//... #5 ... Don't allow user to "Delete" the solved equation
//      If the user has entered an equation, and hit "enter"/solve, the value will be showcased
//      as the Solution, with the Equation = Solution on the bottom
//      Right? Don't let the user delete that screen, there's nothing to delete
//      You can't delete a solved equation, it's finished.
//      so disable, or just make it do nothing
//              they only thing they should be able to do from that point, in terms of changing the screen values
//              is to click clear, or to click a number to start a new equation

//... #6 ... If the user finished an equation
//  and the solution is shown
//  and they THEN click an addition/operator button
//  do nothing, only change the value shown, when they click a number or the clear button

//... #7 ... Consider changing the styling / size of everything / color of certain buttons (grouping the operators, etc)

//... #8 ... Consider an Entry log on the right hand side of the entire calculator
//  such that the user can see all of their previously entered solved equations
//  add a cap to that, show the last 5 or so
